## Platform-Specific Issues

### iOS
- iOS 17.2+ notification permission handling requires explicit user interaction
- Background refresh may be delayed by up to 15 minutes on iOS 17.0+
- WidgetKit complications may have up to 30-second update delay

### watchOS
- Background refresh limited to 4 updates per hour (platform limitation)
- Complications may not update for up to 1 hour in background
- Digital Crown scrolling sensitivity varies by device model

### Authentication & Account Management
- **Phone Authentication Limitations**:
  - International phone numbers may experience SMS delivery delays of 30+ seconds
  - Certain country codes (particularly +7, +86, +91) face intermittent SMS delivery issues
  - Network timeouts during verification may leave account in inconsistent state
  - SMS delivery rates may be throttled by carriers during peak usage times
  - Some regions have carrier restrictions on SMS delivery for verification purposes

- **Email Recovery Limitations**:
  - Email verification links expire after 24 hours
  - Recovery emails may be marked as spam by certain providers
  - Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo sometimes delay verification emails by 5-15 minutes
  - Corporate email filters may block verification emails
  - Non-Latin character support in email addresses can cause rendering issues

- **Cross-Device Authentication**:
  - Watch app cannot initiate authentication independently
  - Authentication state sync between devices may be delayed up to 30 seconds
  - Recovery process can only be completed on iOS device, not Watch
  - Token refresh on Watch relies on iOS device connectivity
  - Authentication persistence has different timeout behaviors across devices

### Watch Complications
- **Platform Limits**:
  - Absolute maximum: 1 update per hour (watchOS system limit)
  - Minimum guaranteed: 1 update per 4 hours (system fallback)
  - Battery conservation: System may delay beyond 1 hour in low power

- **Typical Update Delays** (within platform limits):
  - Circular complication: 15-30 minutes (priority: high)
  - Modular complication: 30-60 minutes (priority: medium)
  - Infograph complication: 15-45 minutes (priority: high)
  - Graphic complication: 30-60 minutes (priority: medium)

- **Implementation Guidelines**:
  1. Always respect the 1-hour absolute limit
  2. Target the typical delays as optimal update windows
  3. Implement graceful degradation if updates are delayed
  4. Use priority levels to optimize update scheduling

- **Performance Boundaries**:
  - Maximum data size: 2KB per complication
  - Update processing time: < 1 second
  - Memory usage: < 5MB per complication
  - Battery impact: < 1% per update cycle

### CloudKit
- Initial sync can take 2-3 minutes on first launch
- Offline mode may miss up to 5 minutes of changes
- Rate limiting: Max 100 operations per minute
- Sync reliability issues in poor network conditions
- Data consistency challenges during rapid changes
- Conflict resolution may require manual intervention
