- Enable community meetups and social interaction
- Provide seamless Apple Watch integration
- Ensure privacy and data security

### Key Features

   - Per-app usage tracking
   - Tiered friction tasks
   - Apple Watch haptic nudges
   - Progressive intervention system

2. **Meetup System**
   - Geo-fenced event creation
   - QR code check-in
   - External chat links
   - Host ranking system

3. **Apple Watch Integration**
   - QR code display for hosts
   - Real-time feedback
   - Haptic notifications
   - Simple watch UI

### ðŸŽ¯ Scope Management
All development MUST adhere to the boundaries defined in `scope_boundaries.md`. This document:
- Explicitly defines what is in and out of scope
- Lists core features vs. non-essential features
- Provides a protocol for feature addition
- Documents any legacy features

Before implementing any new feature or enhancement:
1. Verify it aligns with scope boundaries
2. Ensure it serves core functionality
3. Get explicit approval for anything not clearly in scope
4. Document any approved exceptions

### ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Safeguards
Before implementing any feature, the following questions MUST be answered:

1. **Core Purpose Verification**
   - Does it serve the core focus management purpose?
   - Is it explicitly requested?
   - Could it be simplified further?

2. **Dependency Check**
   - Does it depend on anything not yet approved?
   - Are all dependencies clearly identified?
   - Is the implementation order correct?

3. **Implementation Boundaries**
   - No "while we're at it" additions
   - No speculative functionality
   - No premature optimization
   - One feature at a time

4. **Project Structure**
   - Must fit within approved folder structure
   - No new directories without explicit approval
   - Clear mapping to approved features

5. **Review Process**
   - Regular scope verification
   - Feature completion checks
   - Technical debt assessment
   - Scope drift detection

For detailed guidelines on any of these areas, refer to:
- `project_structure.md` for folder/file organization
- `review_process.md` for review procedures
- `scope_boundaries.md` for feature boundaries

### ðŸŽ¯ Logical Progression and Downstream Impact
When implementing new features or components:
- Always proceed with the most logical next step based on existing architecture
- Consider dependencies and potential downstream impact
- Present only the optimal path forward, not multiple options
- Ensure new implementations maintain compatibility with existing components
- Build in a way that minimizes potential issues for future development

### Technical Stack
- SwiftUI for UI
- Firebase for backend
- Core Data for local storage
- CloudKit for sync
- WatchKit for Apple Watch

## Development Philosophy

### ðŸŽ¯ Start Simple, Add Complexity Only When Needed
Our primary development principle is to begin with the simplest possible implementation that meets the core requirements. This approach:
- Reduces initial complexity and potential points of failure
- Makes components easier to test and maintain
- Allows for faster iteration and feedback
- Provides a solid foundation for future enhancements

Complexity should only be added when:
1. There is a clear, demonstrated need
2. The benefits outweigh the maintenance costs
3. The feature is essential to the core functionality
4. The complexity can be properly tested and documented

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features
The app focuses on three main pillars:

1. **Adaptive Friction Engine**
   - Per-app usage tracking
   - Tiered friction tasks
   - Apple Watch haptic nudges
   - Progressive intervention system

2. **Meetup System**
   - Geo-fenced event creation
   - QR code check-in
   - External chat links (WhatsApp, Signal)
   - Host ranking system

3. **Apple Watch Integration**
   - QR code display for hosts
   - Real-time feedback
   - Haptic notifications
   - Simple watch UI
