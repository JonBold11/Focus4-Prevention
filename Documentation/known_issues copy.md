# Current Implementation Issues

## Status Definitions

### Implementation Status
- **Not Started**: Feature not yet in development
- **Planned**: Approved for development, timeline set
- **In Development**: Actively being worked on
- **In Review**: Code complete, undergoing review/testing
- **Implemented**: Feature complete and verified
- **On Hold**: Development paused (with reason)
- **Deprecated**: No longer supported

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Blocks core functionality
- **High**: Affects major features
- **Medium**: Affects secondary features
- **Low**: Nice to have, non-essential

## Platform-Specific Issues

### iOS
- iOS 17.2+ notification permission handling requires explicit user interaction
- Background refresh may be delayed by up to 15 minutes on iOS 17.0+
- WidgetKit complications may have up to 30-second update delay

### watchOS
- Background refresh limited to 4 updates per hour (platform limitation)
- Complications may not update for up to 1 hour in background
- Digital Crown scrolling sensitivity varies by device model

### Watch Complications
- **Platform Limits**:
  - Absolute maximum: 1 update per hour (watchOS system limit)
  - Minimum guaranteed: 1 update per 4 hours (system fallback)
  - Battery conservation: System may delay beyond 1 hour in low power

- **Typical Update Delays** (within platform limits):
  - Circular complication: 15-30 minutes (priority: high)
  - Modular complication: 30-60 minutes (priority: medium)
  - Infograph complication: 15-45 minutes (priority: high)
  - Graphic complication: 30-60 minutes (priority: medium)

- **Implementation Guidelines**:
  1. Always respect the 1-hour absolute limit
  2. Target the typical delays as optimal update windows
  3. Implement graceful degradation if updates are delayed
  4. Use priority levels to optimize update scheduling

- **Performance Boundaries**:
  - Maximum data size: 2KB per complication
  - Update processing time: < 1 second
  - Memory usage: < 5MB per complication
  - Battery impact: < 1% per update cycle

### CloudKit
- Initial sync can take 2-3 minutes on first launch
- Offline mode may miss up to 5 minutes of changes
- Rate limiting: Max 100 operations per minute
- Sync reliability issues in poor network conditions
- Data consistency challenges during rapid changes
- Conflict resolution may require manual intervention
